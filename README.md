# Arabic_POS_Tagging

This project focuses on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for Arabic text using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages modern NLP libraries and frameworks to build and train models for accurate POS tagging.

## Features
- Preprocessing of Arabic text.
- Training and evaluation of POS tagging models.
- Support for GPU acceleration to handle large datasets efficiently.
